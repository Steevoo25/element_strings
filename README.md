# Breaking Bad Algorithm
The title and credits of the hit series *Breaking Bad* use chemical symbols from the Periodic Table of elements as parts of the words, I thought it would be interesting to see what words can be made __entirely__ from these symbols.
## How to Run
The only requirement for this program is [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### Detailed Steps
- Download Python from the link above
- Either download or Clone this repository
- Open the root directory in a terminal
- run `python ./breaking_bad_algorithm.py`
  
N.B. This project was first suggested to me by my friend Sam over 2 years ago, at which point I attempted it and was unable to provide a fully working program, which is why I have revisited it now.

## TODO
- ! FIX -> first word not working after run (CLI mode)
- Support for sentences
- Data Analysis
    - English Dictionary
    - All (?) Dictionaries
